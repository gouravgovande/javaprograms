// The Type Promotion Rules
// Java defines several type promotion rules that apply to expressions. They are as follows: First,
// all byte, short, and char values are promoted to int, as just described. Then, if one operand
// is a long, the whole expression is promoted to long. If one operand is a float, the entire
// expression is promoted to float. If any of the operands is double, the result is double.


class TypeConversion3 {
	public static void main(String args[]) {
		byte b = 42;
		char c = 'a';
		short s = 1024;
		int i = 50000;
		float f = 5.67f;
		double d = .1234;

		double result = (f * b) + (i/ c) - (d * s);
		System.out.println((f * b) +" + " + (i / c) + " - " + (d * s));
		System.out.println("result =" + result);
